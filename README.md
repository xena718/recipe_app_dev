# YummyApp
YummyApp is a recipe management app that allows users to create recipes, search recipes, save recipes to personal collections, and generate a handy shopping list for selected recipes. 
I used to use gsheet for managing recipe collections. Not any more! I have enjoyed buidling and using the YummyApp along the way. Say goodbye to gsheet for recipe collections and Give my yummyapp a try! --I take feature request, build commonly requested features, and deploy them for  users!
