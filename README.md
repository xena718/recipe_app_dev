# YummyApp
YummyApp is a recipe management app that allows users to create recipes, search recipes, save recipes to personal collections, and generate a handy shopping list for selected recipes. 
I used to use gsheet for managing recipe collections. Not any more! I have enjoyed buidling and using the YummyApp along the way. Say goodbye to gsheet for recipe collections and Give my yummyapp a try! --I take feature request, build commonly requested features, and deploy them for  users!

#### User Page - Safe & Unsafe Products
* Whenever a logged in user searches a product, it is immediately added to and displayed in the users safe and unsafe products list. This makes it easy for the user to see products they've already searched that they can or cant have.

Hello! I'm Chengfeng, a software engineer and scientific researcher in Biotech. I created YummyApp in eight weeks(4-8 hrs per week) during my part-time full-stack engineer study at Hackbright. I'd love to connect with you on [Github](https://github.com/xena718?tab=repositories)!
